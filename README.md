## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo.
2. Run tests to make sure that the program works as expected.
3. Run the application to generate an Excel report based on the JSON file. The JSON file is already included in the project and it will be automatically located inside the folder *Reporting\src\Reporting\Resources*.
4. The output file **Report.xlsx** will be created in the same folder *Reporting\src\Reporting\Resources*.
5. Note that tests create an extra file Report_test.xlsx.
